## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally or deploy it using GitHub Actions and Docker.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or above)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) for CI/CD setup
- Amazon EC2 instance for deployment
- GitHub repository secrets configured for sensitive environment variables

## Environment Variables

Ensure you have the following environment variables set up in your `.env` file and GitHub Secrets:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
NODE_ENV=development  # or production
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auth-microservices.git
   cd auth-microservices
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Locally

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5002`.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on an EC2 instance using Docker and GitHub Actions. The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub, then pulls the latest image to the EC2 instance and runs the container.

### CI/CD Pipeline

#### CI Workflow (`ci-docker-image.yml`)

- Trigger: On push to the main branch
- Steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Log in to Docker Hub
  - Build Docker image
  - Push image to Docker Hub

#### CD Workflow (`cd-deploy-to-ec2.yml`)

- Trigger: After successful CI workflow completion
- Steps:
  - Pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub
  - Stop and remove the old container
  - Run the new Docker container with updated environment variables

### CI Workflow Example:

```yaml
name: CI - Build Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Log in to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
            username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build Docker Image
      run: docker build -t ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/auth-microservices:latest .

    - name: Push Docker image
      run: docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/auth-microservices:latest
```

### CD Workflow Example:

```yaml
name: CD - Deploy to EC2

on:
   workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI - Build Docker Image"]
    types:
      - completed

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted

    steps:
    - name: Pull docker image
      run: sudo docker pull ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/auth-microservices:latest

    - name: Delete Old docker container
      run: sudo docker rm -f auth-microservices-container || true

    - name: Run Docker Container
      run: |
            docker run -d -p 5002:5002 --name auth-microservices-container \
            -e DATABASE_URL="${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}" \
            -e JWT_SECRET="${{ secrets.JWT_SECRET }}" \
            -e EMAIL_USERNAME="${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}" \
            -e EMAIL_PASSWORD="${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}" \
            -e NODE_ENV="development" \
            ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/auth-microservices:latest
```
